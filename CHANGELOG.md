# Changelog

## 9.3.0 (2024-08-27)

Initial fork of <https://github.com/Keats/jsonwebtoken/tree/v9.3.0>

- swap ring with aws-lc-rs
- remove wasm32 support (feel free to contribute it)

Goal is not to have a permanent fork,
but instead to provide a tmp unblocker for people already
switching to aws-lc-rs given rustls et al made that move clear.
